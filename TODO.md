# TODO

- then, the main loop should:
  - check update_at
  - display either the current bit pattern or the current "drift values"
  - based on display, get the activations from the model and display them too
  - (maybe) add one more level of modulation, but perhaps not

## maybe... but not necessarily

- add "wiggle back and forth" detection for reset training?
