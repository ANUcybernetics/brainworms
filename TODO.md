# TODO

- turn off the :display loop, see if I can:

  - manually set the PWM values
  - manually set the display
  - set the knob to iterate (both digit and bitlist mode)
  - check if the predict function is still working, even as the weights go bung
    with ReLU
  - debug the "drift" freq/phase values (I don't think they're working right)

## maybe... but not necessarily

- add "wiggle back and forth" detection for reset training?
